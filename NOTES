find all the intervals that overlap with a given interval N

sort all start and end points.  store each with a pointer to the segment it's on
then do binary search looking for the left endpoint of N
look for the start and end points that are < N.r
if there are any, put all the segments they point to into a set

next have to find intervals that *enclose* N
use an interval tree and look for any point in N.
